  "question_content": "There is a single integer N written on a blackboard.\r\nTakahashi will repeat the following series of operations until all integers not less than 2 are removed from the blackboard:\n\n- Choose one integer x not less than 2 written on the blackboard.\n- Erase one occurrence of x from the blackboard. Then, write two new integers \\left \\lfloor \\dfrac{x}{2} \\right\\rfloor and \\left\\lceil \\dfrac{x}{2} \\right\\rceil on the blackboard.\n- Takahashi must pay x yen to perform this series of operations.\n\nHere, \\lfloor a \\rfloor denotes the largest integer not greater than a, and \\lceil a \\rceil denotes the smallest integer not less than a.\nWhat is the total amount of money Takahashi will have paid when no more operations can be performed?\r\nIt can be proved that the total amount he will pay is constant regardless of the order in which the operations are performed.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the total amount of money Takahashi will have paid, in yen.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2 \\leq N \\leq 10^{17}\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n5\r\n\nHere is an example of how Takahashi performs the operations:\n\n- Initially, there is one 3 written on the blackboard.\n- He chooses 3. He pays 3 yen, erases one 3 from the blackboard, and writes \\left \\lfloor \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 1 and \\left\\lceil \\dfrac{3}{2} \\right\\rceil = 2 on the blackboard.\n- There is one 2 and one 1 written on the blackboard.\n- He chooses 2. He pays 2 yen, erases one 2 from the blackboard, and writes \\left \\lfloor \\dfrac{2}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 1 and \\left\\lceil \\dfrac{2}{2} \\right\\rceil = 1 on the blackboard.\n- There are three 1s written on the blackboard.\n- Since all integers not less than 2 have been removed from the blackboard, the process is finished.\n\nTakahashi has paid a total of 3 + 2 = 5 yen for the entire process, so print 5.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n340\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2888\n\nSample Input 3\n\n100000000000000000\n\nSample Output 3\n\n5655884811924144128",
