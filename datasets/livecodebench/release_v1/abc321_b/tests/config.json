  "question_content": "There is an exam structured as follows.\n\n- The exam consists of N rounds called round 1 to N.\n- In each round, you are given an integer score between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n- Your final grade is the sum of the N-2 of the scores earned in the rounds excluding the highest and lowest.\n- Formally, let S=(S_1,S_2,\\dots,S_N) be the sequence of the scores earned in the rounds sorted in ascending order, then the final grade is S_2+S_3+\\dots+S_{N-1}.\n\n\n\nNow, N-1 rounds of the exam have ended, and your score in round i was A_i.\r\nPrint the minimum score you must earn in round N for a final grade of X or higher.\r\nIf your final grade will never be X or higher no matter what score you earn in round N, print -1 instead.\r\nNote that your score in round N can only be an integer between 0 and 100.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X\r\nA_1 A_2 \\dots A_{N-1}\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- All input values are integers.\n- 3 \\le N \\le 100\n- 0 \\le X \\le 100 \\times (N-2)\n- 0 \\le A_i \\le 100\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 180\r\n40 60 80 50\n\nSample Output 1\n\n70\r\n\nYour scores in the first four rounds were 40, 60, 80, and 50.\r\nIf you earn a score of 70 in round 5, the sequence of the scores sorted in ascending order will be S=(40,50,60,70,80), for a final grade of 50+60+70=180.\r\nIt can be shown that 70 is the minimum score you must earn for a final grade of 180 or higher.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 100\r\n100 100\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\r\n\nYour scores in the first two rounds were 100 and 100.\r\nIf you earn a score of 0 in round 3, the sequence of the scores sorted in ascending order will be S=(0,100,100), for a final grade of 100.\r\nNote that the highest score, 100, is earned multiple times, and only one of them is excluded. (The same goes for the lowest score.)\r\nIt can be shown that 0 is the minimum score you must earn for a final grade of 100 or higher.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5 200\r\n0 0 99 99\n\nSample Output 3\n\n-1\r\n\nYour scores in the first four rounds were 0, 0, 99, and 99.\r\nIt can be shown that your final grade will never be 200 or higher no matter what score you earn in round 5.\n\nSample Input 4\n\n10 480\r\n59 98 88 54 70 24 8 94 46\n\nSample Output 4\n\n45",
