  "question_content": "AtCoder Inc. sells T-shirts with its logo.\nYou are given Takahashi's schedule for N days as a string S of length N consisting of 0, 1, and 2.\nSpecifically, for an integer i satisfying 1\\leq i\\leq N,\n\n- if the i-th character of S is 0, he has no plan scheduled for the i-th day;\n- if the i-th character of S is 1, he plans to go out for a meal on the i-th day;\n- if the i-th character of S is 2, he plans to attend a competitive programming event on the i-th day.\n\nTakahashi has M plain T-shirts, all washed and ready to wear just before the first day.\nIn addition, to be able to satisfy the following conditions, he will buy several AtCoder logo T-shirts.\n\n- On days he goes out for a meal, he will wear a plain or logo T-shirt.\n- On days he attends a competitive programming event, he will wear a logo T-shirt.\n- On days with no plans, he will not wear any T-shirts. Also, he will wash all T-shirts worn at that point. He can wear them again from the next day onwards.\n- Once he wears a T-shirt, he cannot wear it again until he washes it.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of T-shirts he needs to buy to be able to wear appropriate T-shirts on all scheduled days during the N days. If he does not need to buy new T-shirts, print 0.\nAssume that the purchased T-shirts are also washed and ready to use just before the first day.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nS\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the minimum number of T-shirts Takahashi needs to buy to be able to satisfy the conditions in the problem statement.\nIf he does not need to buy new T-shirts, print 0.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1\\leq M\\leq N\\leq 1000\n- S is a string of length N consisting of 0, 1, and 2.\n- N and M are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6 1\n112022\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nIf Takahashi buys two logo T-shirts, he can wear T-shirts as follows:\n\n- On the first day, he wears a logo T-shirt to go out for a meal.\n- On the second day, he wears a plain T-shirt to go out for a meal.\n- On the third day, he wears a logo T-shirt to attend a competitive programming event.\n- On the fourth day, he has no plans, so he washes all the worn T-shirts. This allows him to reuse the T-shirts worn on the first, second, and third days.\n- On the fifth day, he wears a logo T-shirt to attend a competitive programming event.\n- On the sixth day, he wears a logo T-shirt to attend a competitive programming event.\n\nIf he buys one or fewer logo T-shirts, he cannot use T-shirts to meet the conditions no matter what. Hence, print 2.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 1\n222\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3\n\nSample Input 3\n\n2 1\n01\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0\n\nHe does not need to buy new T-shirts.",
